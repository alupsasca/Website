  orbit and take the sharpest images in the history of astronomy: the <a href="https://www.blackholeexplorer.org/" class="svelte-1kfqhrj">Black Hole Explorer</a>. 
  BHEX is designed to peer all the way down to the event
  horizon of a black hole and measure the “photon ring” of light that orbits it.
  Together with an international team of scientists and engineers, we are now
  hard at work designing and prototyping the BHEX instrument, and are gearing up
  to propose it as the next NASA Small Explorers Mission, slated for a 2031
  launch. The journey ahead will be difficult but we are excited for BHEX to fly
  and push our understanding of spacetime to the absolute limit. Read more about
  our mission <a href="https://www.blackholeexplorer.org/bhex-blog/lupsasca-statement" class="svelte-1kfqhrj">HERE</a>.</p> <p class="svelte-1kfqhrj">I am a co-recipient of the 2024 New Horizons Physics Prize from the

  <a href="https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/scientists-predict-countless-rings-of-light-encircle-black-holes/">Sky &amp; Telescope</a>

  to observations at the experimental frontier in black hole astronomy. This

  discusses the potential links between the photon rings targeted by BHEX and
  the holographic principle in quantum gravity.</p> <p class="svelte-1kfqhrj">Black hole observations will also shed light on deep questions in relativistic
  astrophysics. What is the mechanism that powers astrophysical jets? Can
  magnetic fields extract electromagnetic energy from the rotational energy of a
  spinning black hole via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism? This <a href="https://www.ias.edu/news/galactic-lightsabers-answering-longstanding-questions-about-jets-black-holes">2023 IAS feature</a>
